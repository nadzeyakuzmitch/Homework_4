# Faker, Generating test data, and adding package to the comand line app

This is an app for calculations, based on the professor's code. I've fixed all of the pylint issues and made sure everything passes 100%.

To use as a calculator:
* python main.py 2 4 add

To run tests and lint check:
* pytest --num_records=10
* pytest --pylint --cov
